# Welcome to DayZ Survival contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on our community board :sparkles:. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue/ticket to engaging with conversations relating to other issues.

### Issues

If you're new to Github, think of issues as a ticketing system, we use them as a means of tracking bug reports, suggestions, and discussing and/or prototyping for new features and future changes.
This way, any member of our community gets to decide and help improve the community by giving back and voicing their thoughts and wants.

#### Create a new issue

Creating a new issue is as easy as navigating to the [issues](https://github.com/dayz-survival/board/issues) tab and clicking on the [new issue](https://github.com/dayz-survival/board/issues/new/choose) button. There, you'll have to fill in the necessary informating about your report and wait for other members or staff to engage your report with further discussion before the matter is treated.
